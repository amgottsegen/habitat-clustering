The goal of this project was to identify the viability of four endangered native insects in Philadelphia proper: Callophrys gryneus (juniper hairstreak), Datana ranaeceps (post-burn Datana moth), Hemileuca maia (eastern buckmoth) and Satyrium titus (coral hairstreak). Numerous studies have established that insect populations can experience resurgences when more of their host plants become available. This project aimed to determine whether planting the host plants of these four insects in community gardens in Philadelphia could trigger such resurgences. The program uses the maximum separation distance between habitats to determine which gardens are close enough together to form a network of habitats for each of the species.

Ningchuan Xiao's algorithms for createing a point quad tree and performing a circular range search, from his book GIS Algorithms, are used (pointquadtree1.py and pointquadtree2.py).
